# [jQuery Transit 2d]

This is a fork of http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit

Original is great, however I am in desperate need of smooth 2d animation,
yet jquery.transit uses 3d functions which cause problems with scaling vectors (including fonts).

Use at you're own risk.
Please also check the original library.
